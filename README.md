JavaScript Word Search Puzzle Solver

## Description
The goal of a word search puzzle is to find the list of words hidden in the grid.
Words can be discovered horizontally, vertically, diagonally or backwards. 
After coming across a puzzle online, I decided to try to automate the task of solving such a puzzle.
For the actual game, we are using the online word search [game.](https://api.razzlepuzzles.com/wordsearch)
While there are some optimizations I can make to speed up the finding and solving process, the script does automatically solve puzzle.
The positions of the solved words will periodically highlight upon script execution.
